# PGLite Todo App
This is a silly little demo I threw together to check out PGLite, which allows querying a Postgres database running right in your with the power of WASM.  

*Check out their [repo](https://github.com/electric-sql/pglite)*

## Setup
Nothing ðŸ˜† Clone the repo and open the path to the `index.html` in your browser of choice. There's no node_modules, build-step or commands you have to run.  

If that still sounds too cumbersome, you can also click [here](https://mjdeligan.github.io/pglite-todo-demo/) and check out a hosted version. No worries,
your precious Todos are all stored in your local browser!
